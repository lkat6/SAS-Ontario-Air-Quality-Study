# SAS Ontario-Air-Quality-Project
Our air quality directly impacts our health and the natural environment, so we want our air to be as clean as possible. The Ministry of the Environment has a network of 39 ambient (outside) air monitoring stations across the province that collect real-time air pollution data. This information is communicated to the public through Ontario's new Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and as hourly concentrations of each pollutant. The Air Quality Health Index and data collected from our monitoring stations are posted on this website every hour, 24 hrs per day, seven days a week. Using a SAS data analysis, this project sorted out the air pollution data collected between Sept. 2019 and Sept. 2020 and converted the data into multiple visualization reports.
